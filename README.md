# Cross-of-Road-Checkmark-2-May-3-2020
-Colin Hughes

-CPSC 386 Project Checkmark

-Unzip package and import .uproject file into UE4.

-Level "CHECKMARK_1" is already set up to run the game.

-In the blueprint folder, there are several chicken blueprints, the one entitled "bp_chicken_release" is the most updated, while the others are used for debugging.

-There is a slight chance the random spawning of trees and rocks will block the chicken at the start of the game, you will need to simply play the project again to correct this.

-The camera now automatically moves forward, but nothing stops the chicken from going off screen by moving backwards, so be aware of that.

-Several new meshes have been implemented as well.
